# Feel reached at a time when people need it most

Social media feels empty and superficial. It feigns connection and causes feelings of anxiety, depression, isolation, and more. 
And the Covid-19 Pandemic has certainly not helped, causing us to feel more alone than ever. Thus we find it necessary to leverage modern tools to remedy this general sentiment. 

Reach.io is an intimate environment where users feel truly connected, heard, and reached. 

## Key Ideas

* The app should keep tabs on key wellness metrics to forecast wellbeing and take action before negative feelings spiral out of control
* It should provide meaningful and intimate means of communication - no posts or endless recommendation feeds
